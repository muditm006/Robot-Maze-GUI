 The purpose of this project is to develop a program that enables the client to control the robot through a GUI interface within a device. Robot controls like moving forward, moving backwards, and turning should all be controllable through the GUI interface. Additionally, it will have parameters to control the robot’s movements. The program will consist of a ‘robot’ class with an init function that connects the motor pins to the h bridge for power. Within the class, there will exist a function to carry out every part of the path. Therefore, functions that the GUI calls will exist for it to move forward, turn left, turn right, and move backwards. The time and speed at which each motor runs will be able to be regulated through each function. The parameter for the time the robot moves forward and the angle for turns can be regulated within the GUI.
